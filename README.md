pStorageAccess
===============

An example for user access session with time expiration (Storage).

I created an example about how you can to use the Storage feature from HTML5 for user access session with time expiration.

The example has:

1. User and password validation.
2. Time limit for session expiration is about 20 minutes (you can to change this time).
3. Validation user access to the system. (deny when user isn't allowed).

There's a default user and password for you test it.

1. User: teste
2. Password: teste123

I hope this example help you with something. Download and enjoy yourself.

Thanks.
